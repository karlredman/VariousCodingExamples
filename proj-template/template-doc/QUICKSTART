The jist of what you need to do to get a one-off going is below. I'm not
going to deal with telling you all about editing configure.in and the like.
I'm going to presume that you pretty much just want to throw some source 
code into the src/project directory or something and get going....

1. Edit toplevel project files
	AUTHORS, ChangeLog, NEWS, README, COPYING, and INSTALL. 

	COPYING and INSTALL will use the default GNU stuff if 
	you don't provide them.


2. Add source files to your src/ subdirectory and setup your Makefile.am file.
	Presumably, you will just use the src/project directory for a one-off.


3. Edit the bin/Makefile.am file
	Asuming that you want your binaries to be in a convenient place


4. Run 'automake -a' from the toplevel directory.


NOTE:
	If you edit your configure.in file or the like your going to have to
	run 'autoconf' before you run 'automake' 

5. Run './configure' from the toplevel or whatever (if you make a build 
	directory then you probably already have something like this).

6. Run make or 'make distcheck' -assuming that everything when ok up to here.



IF YOUR HAVING TROUBLE AND YOU THING YOU ARE MISSING FILES:
1. I maintain this template in a form that is most simple. Try the following and see if that works.
	        aclocal		#create aclocal.m4
                autoconf	#create configure script and stuff
                automake -a	#make Makefile.in files and such
		./configure	#run the configure script
		make		#make the test program
		make distclean	#cleanup everything and start as outlined above
