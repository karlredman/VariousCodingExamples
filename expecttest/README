This projects demonstrates an expect script running a rsh session on 
another machine that executes the test programs found in bin.

make sure that the test programs are in the PATH for the login you use.

you will have to edit the expect script found in scripts/ to set the path properly.

also, of coarse, make sure that 'expect' is in your path properly.


HOWTO RUN THIS STUFF:
	open 2 terminals: one to watch things happening in the background of
the machine that the test programs are on and another to execute the 
expect program.

	use 'scripts/watch_script' to watch background processes and cat the 
nohup file

	use 'scripts/expect_script' to run the programs the wrong way

	use /scripts/expect_script2' to run the programs in a more right way

	use /scripts/expect_script3' to run the programs in an even more right way

that's it!
