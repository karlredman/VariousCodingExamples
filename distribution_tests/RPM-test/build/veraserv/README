test programs for RPM-test packaging procedures (to be integrated into a build process)

proj1/	-containes a program with a binary
proj2/	-containes a program with a library
proj3/	-containes a program with a binary and a library and documentation


proj1 is dependant on a 3rd party runtime library in /opt/sfw 
and a proj2 library

proj3 is dependant on a 3rd party runtime libraries in /opt/v3p and /opt/sfw

/opt/sfw is used for GNU software 
/opt/v3p is used for other 3rd party software
/opt/verascape is used for verascape software


the makefile will do the following:
1. make the projects in order
2. execute the copyfiles.sh script to move project libs and binaries into production directories
3. create an RPM based on the veraserv.spec file

Note: to execute the binaries from the proper directories we will have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH properly to the various lib directories that we are using in /opt


notest about packaging:
There are 2 levels of conflics, those of the individual subpackages and those of the source package. This means that complete packages can be rendered incompatible with other complete packages and that individual package components can be rendered incompatible with other components. Furthermore, packages may be given serial numbers that affect whether there is a conflict or not.

serial # = build number
version = marketing release number
release = version release number (number of build of this release)
