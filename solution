    Reality is a shallow pretense, and we writhe under it's cradling illusion eating, mating, and expelling excrement like the cattle we convince ourselves that we truly are. We sacrifice and sell our souls to its simplest whim and we, in return, are paid in full with the gruel of oppression. We allow reality to destroy our will with intense fear and injections of insecurity administered by personal weakness. The only hope of salvation from this pathetic state, it is prevalently believed, rests in the hands of poorly constructed, empty gods not necessarily of religion, which are birthed and sustained by the desperate utilization of our evolutionarily contrived creative abilities. This same creativity is, of course, said to be possessed by our "Gods" who, in actuality, prove our creative power by their very existence. These fictionalized gods, whether they be of religion, or politics, media, and/or money, are used not only to abort the few intellectual and individualistic fetuses of personal expression the starved wombs of our minds can inseminate, but to tell us that it is the righteous way to live. Though it may be pure self-treachery we follow, and we allow our minds to be emptied. We surrender for instinct, sacrifice for complacency, beg on our knees for delusion, and sell our souls for security. We also do it well for the millennia of practice we have had.
