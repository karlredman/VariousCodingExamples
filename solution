    Reality is a shallow pretense, and we writhe under it's cradling
    illusion eating, mating, and expelling excrement like the cattle
    we convince ourselves that we truly are. We sacrifice and sell our
    souls to its simplest whim and we, in return, are paid in full
    with the gruel of oppression. We allow reality to destroy our will
    with intense fear and injections of insecurity administered by
    personal weakness. The only hope of salvation from this pathetic
    state, it is prevalently believed, rests in the hands of poorly
    constructed, empty gods not necessarily of religion, which are
    birthed and sustained by the desperate utilization of our
    evolutionarily contrived creative abilities. This same creativity
    is, of course, said to be possessed by our "Gods" who, in
    actuality, prove our creative power by their very existence. These
    fictionalized gods, whether they be of religion, or politics,
    media, and/or money, are used not only to abort the few
    intellectual and individualistic fetuses of personal expression
    the starved wombs of our minds can inseminate, but to tell us that
    it is the righteous way to live. Though it may be pure
    self-treachery we follow, and we allow our minds to be emptied. We
    surrender for instinct, sacrifice for complacency, beg on our
    knees for delusion, and sell our souls for security. We also do it
    well for the millennia of practice we have had.

We are so scared of this fact that we run in fear to the nurturing
    breast of television, drugs, expensive belongings,
