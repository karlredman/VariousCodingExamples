test programs for RPM-test packaging procedures (to be integrated into a build process)

proj1/	-containes a program with a binary
proj2/	-containes a program with a library
proj3/	-containes a program with a binary and a library and documentation


proj1 is dependant on a 3rd party runtime library in /opt/sfw 
and a proj2 library

proj3 is dependant on a 3rd party runtime libraries in /opt/v3p and /opt/sfw

/opt/sfw is used for GNU software 
/opt/v3p is used for other 3rd party software
/opt/verascape is used for verascape software


the makefile will do the following:
1. make the projects in order
2. execute the copyfiles.sh script to move project libs and binaries into production directories
3. create an RPM based on the veraserv.spec file

Note: to execute the binaries from the proper directories we will have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH properly to the various lib directories that we are using in /opt
