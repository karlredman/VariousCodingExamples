test programs and mock 3rd party libraries for RPM-test packaging procedures (to be integrated into a build process)

packaging install locations:
/opt/sfw is used for GNU software 
/opt/v3p is used for other 3rd party software
/opt/verascape is used for verascape software

all the /opt/ subdirectories adhere to the Solaris pkg naming convention.

the makefile will do the following:
1. clean up the production directories
2. make the 3rd party stuff as needed
3. make the veraserv stuff as needed

see the veraserv README file for more information on the projects
